# Express.js Server Response Delay Bug
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where the server introduces an unnecessary delay before responding to requests.  The bug causes slow loading times and might trigger timeouts in clients.

## Bug Description
The server includes a 5-second timeout in its response handling. This artificial delay is problematic in a production environment.

## Solution
The solution removes the `setTimeout` function, allowing the server to respond immediately to client requests. This ensures quick and efficient response times.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies (if any).
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server with the bug.
5. Observe the delay before receiving the "Hello World!" response.
6. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the server with the solution applied.
7. Notice the immediate response.
